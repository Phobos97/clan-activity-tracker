## Overview

CAT is a plugin designed to assist you in monitoring the activity of your clan or friends chat members in a neat and organized fashion.

</br>

## Features

- Tracks the date a player was last seen.
- Tracks the date of the last message a player sent.
- Records the number of messages sent since tracking began.
- Recognizes players by their RSN; a name change will result in a new entry.
- Saves data to a `.csv` file in the directory `/.runelite/CAT/`.

</br>

## Chat Type Options

You can choose to track either clan or friends chat data via the dropdown menu in the "Chat Type" setting.

</br>

## File Naming

The data file is named using the clan or friends chat name with spaces replaced by underscores. The filename ends with the file suffix specified in the plugin settings.

**Example Filename:**  
`CHATNAMEHERE_RSNHERE_log.csv`

</br>

## Data Example

Below is an example in `Excel`, of what the data looks like after it has been recorded:
